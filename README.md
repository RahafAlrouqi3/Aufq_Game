# üìå Introduction

‚ÄúAfuq‚Äù is an interactive educational app specifically designed to open up new horizons of imagination for children. The app allows kids to become part of the story, where they can make decisions that influence the course of events, creating a unique and enjoyable learning experience. It aims to inspire children through exciting adventures filled with heroes and surprises, making learning both fun and interactive.

 # üö© What is the problem ?

Many children struggle with a lack of interest in reading and learning due to traditional methods that may be rigid or non-interactive, leading to a loss of motivation. Additionally, some children lack environments that stimulate creativity and critical thinking, which are important for developing their intellectual and personal skills. Furthermore, parents and educators face challenges in providing engaging educational activities that foster language, reading, and thinking skills in an enjoyable and captivating way.

 # üí° What is our solution ?

1.Enhancing Children's Motivation to Read: 
‚ÄúAfuq‚Äù offers interactive stories that allow children to become part of the narrative, increasing their excitement for reading and exploring events. They feel like they play an active role in shaping the story‚Äôs progression.

2. Encouraging Critical and Creative Thinking:  
By providing multiple choices and puzzles within the story, the app encourages children to think in different ways and make decisions, strengthening their critical and creative thinking skills.

3.Providing an Interactive Learning Experience:  
Instead of static content, "Afuq" offers an immersive experience where children can interact with characters and choose various paths, making learning enjoyable and breaking down the barrier between education and entertainment.

# ü§ñ Our Methodolgy

The process of story generation using artificial intelligence is an exciting field within AI and Natural Language Processing.

## ‚úÖ Data

We utilize a combination of internally generated datasets through data    scraping and a dataset generator, along with  datasets that include a variety of labeled children‚Äôs stories reflecting cultural and educational themes relevant to our application.

## üìà Evaluation

**Introduction to Evaluation:**

In this context, accuracy is measured through semantic evaluation, which aims to assess how well the generated story aligns with the expected standards of quality, meaning, context, and structure. Our goal is to use semantic similarity as a metric to evaluate how closely the generated story matches the expected or required story.

**Semantic Evaluation of Story Generation:**

In this evaluation, we attempt to measure how well the meaning and content align between the expected stories (which are predefined as a standard) and the generated stories by the model. This evaluation helps determine how well the model can produce story content that meets the cognitive and aesthetic expectations.

**The evaluation was applied as follows:**

**1.Preparation:**

A set of expected stories was pre-prepared. These stories covered a wide range of domains such as fiction, history, adventures, and children's stories.
The expected stories were collected manually via data scraping or automated story generation tools, ensuring they aligned with the user‚Äôs expected patterns.

**A.Story Generation:**
The AI model (Aalam) was used to generate stories based on prompts or initial inputs provided to the model.
**B.Sentence Embeddings:**
The "SentenceTransformer" model (such as all-MiniLM-L6-v2) was used to convert both expected and generated stories into numerical representations that could be compared.
**C.Similarity Calculation:**
Cosine similarity was applied between the embeddings of each expected story and the generated story to calculate how well their meanings matched.
**D.Semantic Accuracy:**
Similarity was calculated across all generated and expected stories, resulting in a semantic accuracy percentage that reflects how closely the generated stories align with the expected stories.

**2.Evaluation and Results:**
**A.Semantic Accuracy:**
Upon applying the evaluation, we achieved a semantic accuracy of 95.16% by comparing the generated stories with the expected ones. This indicates that the model was able to generate stories that closely matched the required content in terms of both meaning and context.

**3.Analysis:**
**A.Achieving High Alignment:** The high cosine similarity between the generated and expected stories reflects the model's ability to mimic narrative patterns and produce story content that matches the expectations.
**B.Model Strength:** The model demonstrated a strong ability to generate rich content and meaningful narratives based on the input context. Additionally, the diversity in generated stories reflects the model's flexibility in adapting to different narrative styles.
**C.Future Improvements:** Despite the high alignment, there may still be minor differences in fine details or creative treatment that could be improved in some cases.

**4.Recommendations for Improvement:**
**A.Training the Model on More Stories:** It is crucial to improve the model by using a larger and more diverse dataset of stories from various fields to enhance generation accuracy in different contexts.
**B.Cultural Understanding Training:** Some stories may require cultural or social context-specific adjustments that can be improved to enhance the accuracy of the generated content.

**5.Conclusion:**
By evaluating the semantic accuracy of story generation, we were able to measure how successful the model was in producing content that aligns with expectations. This method proves effective in applications requiring creative content generation such as children‚Äôs stories, novels, or interactive narratives
